q. can we redeploy after m2
a. yes, but perhaps wait until after grades are relased for m1 and m2

the repos don't close (wink)
nothing stops you from deploying (wink * 2)

if you want to redeploy:
* ensure all commits are pushed
* pull from remote server (login to linserv1 or whatever)
* forever... stop and start again
* after you stop, pause for a few seconds
	* use ps | grep your net id to make sure no processes are running
