# Final Project, Due <strike>WED, Nov 29th at 11pm</strike> __MON, Dec 4th at 11pm__


## Overview 

Create a __small__ web application using Express and MongoDB. Build the application incrementally over the course of 4 weeks.

<a name="requirements">

## Project Requirements

### Requirements

* You must use Express and MongoDB (or other server-side framework and database with permission)
* You must write your own code, with annotations/references added for any code sourced from books, online tutorials, etc.

### Grading Rubric

__Completing the milestones leading up to the due date is required!__ Milestones 1 - 3 are worth over half of your final project grade.

* (15 points) Milestone #1 - requirements, draft data model, and a skeleton application
* (20 points) Milestone #2 - deployment attempt and a single working form (__You cannot change _your idea_ for your final project after this__)
* (20 points) Milestone #3 - two working forms and proof of work on research topics
* (45 points total) Completed project
    * (15 points) minimum 3 x forms or ajax interactions (__excluding login__)
    * (6 points) minimum 3 x any of the following (can be the same): 
        * original Constructors (that is, a constructor you've written yourself), including methods added to prototype
        * Object.create (where prototype matters)
        * es6 classes 
        * original higher order functions or these built-in higher order functions on the Array object: map, reduce, filter
    * (2 points) minimum 2 x mongoose schemas
    * (9 points) stability / security
        * simple validation on user input to prevent application from crashing
        * doesn't allow user input to be displayed unescaped directly on page
        * pages that require authentication cannot be accessed without authentication
        * data specified as private to a user cannot be viewed by another user
        * etc.
    * (5 points) _originality_ 
        * is not mostly based on existing homework
        * majority of code is not from online tutorial
    * (8 points) worth of research topics; see below


{% comment %}
* provide api end points
* what data is authenticated
* urls of where data
{% endcomment %}

### 11/09 at 11pm - Milestone 2 - Initial Deployment and First Form (20 points)

1. attempt to deploy your code to Courant's _compute_ and assignment servers by following [instructions](homework/deploy.html)
2. <span class="warning">use [this form to submit your deployed site](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxPUKkpkk5UMwtUarE4kMBGplYg7piTIIdH_ASWm_e9A2ZtQ/viewform)</span>
3. your submission won't be graded unless the form above is sent with urls to your deployed site
4. your deployed site should contain the following progress:
    * __one working form (that is not login or registration)__ 
        * ...that should allow data to be modified or deleted
        * the results of submitting this form should be apparent/viewable
    * show _some_ progress on at least 1 of your research topics,  __it doesn't have to be fully working... stub code from documentation or pseudocode is adequate__
        * consequently, a link to the github repository / line no that shows any proof of work is sufficient
        * or, if it's something that's already visible, a link to the a page on your site that's deployed to the server

<br>
<br>
<br>


### 11/17 at 11pm - Milestone 3 - 2nd Form and More Progress on Research (20 points)

Note - this due date may change!

1. make at least 3 additional commits to add:
    * your 2nd form / ajax interaction
    * make more progress on your research topics
2. redeploy your code to Courant's server by running git pull and restarting forever (__do not do this until you receive your milestone #2 grades__)
    1. `ssh` into linserv1 or linserv2 (remember, you have to go to access.cims.nyu.edu first)
    2. `cd` into your project directory (should be in `~/opt/NETID-final-project`)
    3. run `forever stopall` and `forever start bin/www` 
        * you'll have to use the full path to forever, likely `~/usr/local/node_modules/bin/forever`
        * and perhaps the full bath to `bin/www`
3. __[fill out form to submit assignment](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBpsaoEs1zSEG7-Sf-kkaZeU07nDEsjzEpgyzB-nUvdVApFw/viewform)__; it will contain:
    * __both working forms or ajax interactions (that are not login or registration)__ 
    * a link to show code changes since milestone #2:
        * start with the url to your repository: `https://github.com/nyu-csci-ua-0480-007-fall-2017/NETID-final-project/`
        * and append the following to the url: `compare/master@%7B04-09-17%7D...master`

	* Maybe a card game building off of handy (blackjack) 
    * or something like Cookie Clicker ...
	* or a Battleship clone
	* or a platformer
* Or... whatever you can come up with!
